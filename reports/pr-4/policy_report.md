| # | File | Line | Rule | Issue |
|---|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | `payment.js` | 7 | `JS-SECRET-001` | Hardcoded secret detected in client-side code. Never expose secrets in frontend. |
| 2 | `payment.js` | 8 | `JS-SECRET-001` | Hardcoded secret detected in client-side code. Never expose secrets in frontend. |
| 3 | `payment.js` | 9 | `JS-SECRET-001` | Hardcoded secret detected in client-side code. Never expose secrets in frontend. |
| 4 | `payment.js` | 10 | `JS-SECRET-001` | Hardcoded secret detected in client-side code. Never expose secrets in frontend. |

| 2 | `payment.js` | 28 | `JS-STORAGE-001` | Storing sensitive data in localStorage is insecure. Use HttpOnly cookies or secure session storage. |
| 3 | `payment.js` | 30 | `JS-STORAGE-001` | Storing sensitive data in localStorage is insecure. Use HttpOnly cookies or secure session storage. |
| 4 | `payment.py` | 31 | `PY-CRYPTO-001` | Weak hashing algorithm (MD5/SHA1). Use secure alternatives. |
